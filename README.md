## Anime to Front-end Developer

As an adolescent, I loves anime. Afterwards, it brought me to interest such as playing RPG 🎮 games. A journey to Japan 🗾 about learning game development brought me in contact with web-technologies such as HTML5 and the canvas API. Today, I am doing front-end development for the web and mobile.

## Open Source Contribution

I am a believer in open-source as the future of software development. Open-source are the public infrastructures that serves the community 🌍. Thus, I am currently trying to work on:

1. 🏪 an open source e-commerce store to help small businesses
2. 🎨 a design system for creating design tokens for developers

## Front-end and Startups

I mostly build websites using front-end technology stacks such as React, Vue.js etc. I joined a couple of startups, so I am fluent with LEAN startup methodologies. I enjoyed building rapid prototypes and MVP 🛠️ and getting feedbacks from users to learn about how I can serve their needs. I built a project for an NGO too.
